  Yutaka has been the only health professional who has been able to effectively
  manage the symptoms of chronic arthritis in my hip and neck, and my ongoing
  jaw (TMJ) problems.  Yutaka's unique combination of remedial massage and CST
  has increased my mobility and decreased my pain.  He's an incredibly
  knowledgeable, caring and professional practitioner. "
