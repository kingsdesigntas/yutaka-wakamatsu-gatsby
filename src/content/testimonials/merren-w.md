  Yutaka’s CranioSacral Therapy is a profound experience with every single
  session. You remain clothed while laying on a massage table while the head and
  legs are gently supported, and towels covering for extra warmth and comfort. 


  Yutaka is very caring, highly knowledgeable and intuitive during the session… and I believe this wonderful combination of attributes ensures the body can heal in the most effective ways.  


  After each session my back, pelvis and neck feel realigned and any headaches completely disappear. Straight after each therapy session I feel a bit drowsy so I like to drink plenty of water, but following this my energy levels are much higher, I feel lighter, happier and more energetic. The benefits have been so powerful for me, more than a regular massage treatment. 


  My son (12 years old) also has monthly CranioSacral Therapy sessions with Yutaka for the past year or more. The benefits for him have been most noticeable at school with increased concentration, greater interest, balancing his emotions, and recovering from muscle aches and growing pains. The transformation of his overall health and happiness is astounding. 


  Thank you Yutaka for supporting my families health, I cannot think what we would do without you!”
