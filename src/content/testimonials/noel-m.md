  I have experienced ongoing back pain for a number of years and I have visited
  a number of different massage therapists and physios to relive this pain.  I
  also know within the first 30 seconds if a masseur is going to help.  Tired
  and stiff muscles and minimal exercise means I look forward to my weekly
  visits to Yutaka. Yutaka immediately knows where to hit the trigger points to
  loosen muscles and tendons


  I would highly recommend Yutaka if you are looking for relief through a loosening of muscles and joints, freedom in movement and a better week ahead


  I certainly look forward to my regular consultation with Yutaka
