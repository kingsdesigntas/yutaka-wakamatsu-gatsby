text: "Yutaka is a very skilled CranioSacral and Massage therapist. I have been
  having both CranioSacral and Massage with him for several years and I have
  never felt so relaxed as when having the treatment. CranioSacral and Massage
  has helped me with many things, but mostly has been the only relief I have
  found from migraine headaches during and after pregnancy. I find CranioSacral
  Therapy also helps with treatment of stress and anxiety. It is a relaxing and
  non-invasive treatment and I can't recommend Yutaka more highly. "
