text: I have been having CranioSacral Therapy with Yutaka for many years now.
  Yutaka is a very kind and compassionate therapist who is willing to share is
  extensive knowledge of the human body. Each time I am amazed by his abilities
  to pick up what is happening in my body and the incredible sense of relaxation
  that comes with his work. I walk away feeling grounded, in balance and vital
  in health. I have noticed a profound change in my overall health, both
  physically and mentally since receiving regular sessions. Thanks Yutaka!
