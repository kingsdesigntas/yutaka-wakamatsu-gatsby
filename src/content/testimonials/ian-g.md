text: I have had the pleasure and benefit of regular massage with Yutaka for
  about three years now.  He is both an excellent therapist and one of natures
  gentlemen. As a practising dentist, stiffness and soreness from sitting and
  working intensely is a constant problem; regular massage with Yutaka has
  certainly helped me to maintain my mobility, reduce my discomfort as well as
  reducing my general stress levels. I recommend Yutaka very highly.
