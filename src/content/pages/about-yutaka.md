  Yutaka has many years of Judo experience and became interested in Remedial Massage as a modality that could incorporate his extensive knowledge from Judo training and body conditioning. Yutaka gained his Diploma of Remedial Massage qualification in July 2012. Since he first undertook postgraduate training in CranioSacral Therapy (CST) in December 2013, Yutakaâ€™s passion for CST has grown, as he has witnessed the profound benefits of CST to his clients and the holistic healing approach of CST to treating pain, dysfunction and mental wellbeing. In December 2016, Yutaka gained techniques-level certification (CST-T) through the Upledger Institute Australia. Yutaka has advanced to CranioSacral Therapy training and support of other practitioners through his role as a Teacher Assistant at the Upledger Institute Australia. He became a certified Upledger CranioSacral Study Group leader in Hobart region in 2020. This role requires Yutaka to review and disseminate CST techniques and knowledge for health practitioners.

He is experienced in deep tissue and trigger point techniques and has developed a strong reputation for remedial massage to treat a wide variety of clients at The Massage Centre of Hobart in Salamanca since 2012.
