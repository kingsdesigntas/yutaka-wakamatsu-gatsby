  ### What is CranioSacral Therapy (CST)?


  CranioSacral Therapy is a gentle touch and non-invasive soft tissue therapy used in the treatment of a number of different complaints. It is also a powerful therapy that affects the central nervous system to assist in improving function throughout the body system. It is suitable for all ages, from infants to the elderly. 


  The craniosacral system in our body produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), reabsorbs it in the brain and circulates it around the brain and the spinal cord. The CSF is enclosed by a three-layered membrane system that attaches to the bones of the skull on the inside, to the vertebrae of the upper neck and to the sacrum in the lower back. The craniosacral system makes the little openings rhythmically in the skull and vertebral column that allow passage of sensation through major nerves going to all parts of the body. 


  CranioSacral Therapists uses the bones of the head and sacral bone to act as a handle and palpate or listen to the membranes of the craniosacral system. CranioSacral Therapists find the areas of restricted movement that compromise craniosacral system function and work to restore their normal motion. In doing this work, CranioSacral Therapy is often able to improve the function of the nervous and endocrine systems by improving the environment in which these systems do their work.


  CranioSacral Therapy was developed by Dr. John E. Upledger, D.O., an osteopathic physician and researcher at the Michigan State University in the early 1970s. He established the Upledger Institute in Florida in 1985; now his CranioSacral Therapy techniques and research are being recognised and and widely incorporated in Remedial Massage Therapy, Physiotherapy, Chiropractic, Osteopathic and many other therapies all over the world.


  #### What should I expect?


  For this treatment, you will lie down, fully clothed, on the clinic table and make yourself comfortable. The therapist first conducts a whole body evaluation to identify any restriction within your internal body system. The therapist touches your body lightly to sense connectivity of your tissues. During the treatment it is not uncommon for clients to become deeply relaxed, even fall asleep. As the therapist conducts the treatment, you may feel a sensation of heat or warmth and a gentle pulse from the restricted areas of your craniosacral system. The therapy may also evoke sensations that recall prior injuries or events from the past. Some clients experience a strong emotional response during or after treatment. Everybody is different and each person’s experience is unique to them.


  After the treatment, you may feel invigorated and full of energy or a little dozy or tired, or even a little emotional. People often report that they sleepheavily after the treatment or even that they feel worse for 24 hours or so. In order for change to occur sometimes discomfort is felt. The healing process of change often continues for many days or longer after the treatment, as the body adapts to the subtle changes that have been made. 


  #### How many sessions will I need for treatment?


  The extent of treatment you require will depend on your reason for seeking treatment and how long you have suffered with your condition. Generally, the longer you have had a condition, the more treatment you require. This is because your body has had to develop coping strategies for dealing with the problem, causing it to become multifaceted.


  I usually recommend at least three sessions to release tension patterns, restrictions or affect the functioning of all body system. After the series of sessions, I review the treatment plan. If I feel progress is not being made, I will suggest alternative treatments or refer you to another specialist.
