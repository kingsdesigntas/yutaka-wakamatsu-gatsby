  **What is Remedial Massage?**


  Remedial massage is a manual manipulation of soft tissue which aims to treat muscles that are damaged, knotted, tense or immobile. It is useful for a number of body dysfunctions that affect the muscles, tendons and bones.


  Remedial massage is used to locate and repair damaged areas of the body and speed up the bodyâ€™s own healing processes. The pressure applied in this healing treatment can either be strong and deep or gentle and shallow, depending on the problem or pain threshold.


  General massage increases lymph and blood flow to help reduce inflammation in the affected area. It reduces tension and stress in the muscle, giving an overall sense of relief and increases muscle tone by helping muscle groups to work more effectively.

  **Combination of Remedial Massage and CranioSacral Therapy**


  Yutaka also offers a combination of Remedial Massage and CranioSacral Therapy. For instance, you receive his Remedial Massage to release connective tissue (muscle, fascia, ligament, tendon) and then experience CranioSacral Therapy to enhance your CranioSacral System to tune up your whole body. The dual therapy approach works very well synergistically, to treat both localised tissues by Remedial Massage and treat root causes of the condition by CranioSacral Therapy at once.
